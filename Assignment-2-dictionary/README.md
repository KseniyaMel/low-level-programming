# Assignment №2: Dictionary
---
Our task is to implement a dictionary. It will provide a correspondence between keys and values. Each entry contains the address of the next entry, a key, and a value. Keys and values in our case are null-terminated strings.
* `colon.inc` - define a colon macro to create dictionary words

* `dict.asm` - define a function find_word 

* `words.inс` - define dictionary words

* `main.asm` -  define reading the input string in a buffer of maximum 255 characters long and trying to find this key in dictionary
